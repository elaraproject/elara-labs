## Content-wise

- [ ] Finish the section on quantum mech 2 (hydrogen atom with operators)
- [ ] Finish QED part (QFT part 1)
- [ ] Create a new page describing how to derive the weak form for finite element methods from the strong form of a PDE

## Project Elara library (youtube channel)

- The idea is to create a video follow-along for the Elara Handbook for theoretical and applied physics (and also bonus content that's not in the Handbook)
- Each video will be freely downloadable (the video will say "free downloading available (see description for Google drive link)" in its intro)
- We can insert videos with visualizations into the slides, use [QMsolve library](https://github.com/quantum-visualizations/qmsolve?tab=readme-ov-file) to create visualizations
- Also add a google drive link to the public folder with all videos ready to download
