## (Non-)patent & license stuff

In general, we want to publish as quick as possible to prevent someone from patenting the stuff and making it non-public-domain. If we release it into the public domain, we **automatically** make the work un-patentable, so no one else can patent it, and that is the point.

Other information:
- So there are a few patents and prior research papers that refer to similar things as what we're developing independently
- For these, we will simply state (in Elara Handbook, on a specific page in the foreword) that "in the course of our work, we came across various patents and prior research in the literature that developed similar technologies or contained similar ideas. While we conducted our research and developed our technology independently, we want to recognize their contributions, which is why we mention them here. This is certainly not a comprehensive list; anyone is welcome to alert us of something they developed, and we would be glad to include their work/patent/research on our list." Then make a list of the patents/papers and a citation (MLA style but I'll do it in BibTeX), as well as the (similar) ideas.
	- E.g. this patent that's super similar but with diode lasers for solar-based pumping and a different ground receiver scheme https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100276547A1/en?oq=US20100276547A1 as well as the "Cited By" list at the bottom of the page
- For things that we do reference/build on (and in general we will only reference research papers in the literature, not patents), as opposed to developing independently, we will follow standard procedure for citing the work (BibTeX, inline citation + date, paraphrase instead of copy, etc.)


## Acknowledgement policy

There is an excellent acknowledgement that we should add to all our papers and other publications, which comes from [this paper](http://www.ke5fx.com/vch1006/Wang_1989_Subcompact_hydrogen_maser_atomic_clocks.pdf). It reads as follows:

> _"The author recognizes his inability to cite all recent contributions in the subject area. He regrets any omissions."_ (from Wang (1989), _Subcompact Hydrogen Maser Atomic Clocks_)
