Welcome! This is the Elara Labs research documentation. It is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault that contains our work, all open-sourced. You can run this locally by downloading the Obsidian software, and opening it as a vault. It is also viewable online on the [Elara Labs documentation website](https://publish.obsidian.md/elara-labs).

> **Note:** Be aware that since this vault uses a lot of [Excalidraw drawings](https://excalidraw.com/), you need to install the [Obsidian Excalidraw plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/) to be able to view them.

> **Important information for researchers:** Pages in this markdown vault should be **archived** when developed to a level of sufficient detail and completeness to be ported directly to the Elara Handbook. For this, a deprecation/archival notice should be added to the top of the page, stating that the content has been moved to the Handbook and the version currently within the repository is now archived.
