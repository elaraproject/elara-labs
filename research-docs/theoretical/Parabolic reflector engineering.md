## Mesh parabolic reflectors

Note that in general, light of a wavelength $\lambda$ can be reflected by a reflector that is smooth up to $\lambda/10$. Which means that 1cm microwaves can be reflected by a 0.1cm (i.e. 1mm) mesh rather than needing one solid parabolic reflector, saving material, cost, and weight. This is very relevant for terrestrial use.
