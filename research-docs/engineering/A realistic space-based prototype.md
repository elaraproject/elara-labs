We will have to accept that our ground-based receiver stations will not be able to capture most of the energy that comes from orbit, at least not initially. This arises from two fundamental limitations of our system:

- From theory, the diffraction limit means that the minimum spot size from geostationary orbit is $w_\text{earth} = \sqrt{2D\lambda/\pi}$, which we derived in [[Ideal laser beam divergence]]. We also showed in [[Computing the theoretical minimum divergence beam]] that this is a fundamental limit that cannot be overcome, and even in this ideal circumstance, a maximum of only $1/e^2 \approx 86\%$ of the beam's intensity can be concentrated in this region.
- From practical considerations, $w_\text{earth} \approx \pu{7.4 km}$ for 1 GHz waves and $w_\text{earth} \approx \pu{749m}$ for 12 GHz waves. This is notwithstanding the fact that any frequencies $>\pu{2GHz}$ will likely get attenuated greatly in adverse weather conditions and incur huge power losses, so our best-case spot size (beam radius) for the beam at Earth's surface is likely to be at least a kilometer, if not more.

This means that to capture the power efficiently, we'll need huge, kilometer-wide arrays, but starting out, we don't have that available to us, especially because of our plan to convert old oil rigs into receiving platforms (and we'll need a lot of those to cover $\pu{1 km} \times \pu{1 km}$ of area!). Thus, for our prototype, it is desirable to choose a point in the Southern Pacific, which is remote and uninhabited, so that even if our beam is 10 km wide on the surface, and even if we will only be able to collect maybe 0.5-1% of that with a 100m-sized total receiving area array, the space-to-Earth beam would be located far from any population centers for maximum safety.
